#Popeye on Mars

This project is solving the [Deployable Greenhouse] challenge.

It was developed at [hackerspace.gr] in Athens for [International Space Apps Challenge 2013]

Our solution is a deployable, reusable spinach greenhouse for Mars.
Internally, a fully equipped aeroponic system operates for ~45 days, having all the needed resources, sensors and electronic systems to stabilize the internal environment and help the spinach growth.
Also, there are systems for harvesting produced oxygen during the process and the plants at the end of it.
Externally, photovoltaic panels provide power, while several cover layers protect the system against Mars extreme conditions.
